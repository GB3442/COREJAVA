ans : - Redefining a method of parent into cbild class with the same method signature and paremeters is callled as
        method overring.

Rules of method overiding?

1) We can not perform method overding in same class
2) Overriding method must have to take exact same parameters of overridden method.
3) We can not restrict the scope of overridden method.  i.e super classs public method can not be taken as private,
   default or protected....           private > default > protected > public
4) Final method can not be overide
5) We can not overide private method
6) We can not override static method if we do that then it will become a method hiding.


WHat is Type Casting in java ?
ans: Converting one type of variable into another type is called as tpye casting.

Two tpyes of casting in java
1) Upcasting / implicit / widening casting
ans : Storing sub class object into super class reference variable is called as upcasting or implicit casting.

2) DownCasting/explicit/ narrowing :
ans : Storing super class object reference into sub class reference variable us called as dowmcasting.


   ex:
      class super{

      }
      class sub extends super{

       public static void main(String[]args){

           //implicit casting or upcasting
           super s1=new sub();   // here no need to do casting explicitly.

           // downcasting
           sub s2=(sub)new super();    // here no CE but at runtime classCastException occoured

            // this will perform downcasting.
            sub s=(sub)s1;

       }
      }

          =============== Importent point ========
   In upcasting we can access only super class variables and method. We can access only overrided method of super class
   in sub class. We can not access sub class variables and methods... except overrided methods.

   in upcasting only sub class overrideen methods are accessible. IF we add another method in sub class then this method
   is not accessible.


   => In Java, we rarely use Upcasting. We use it when we need to develop a code that deals with only the parent class.
   => Downcasting is used when we need to develop a code that accesses behaviors of the child class.



   => We can not use super keyword in static method i.e main method.
